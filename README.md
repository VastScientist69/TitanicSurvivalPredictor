Titanic Survival Prediction Model
üìñ Project Overview
This project involves building a machine learning model to predict the survival of passengers aboard the RMS Titanic. The infamous sinking of the Titanic in 1912 led to the deaths of 1,502 out of 2,224 passengers and crew. While there was an element of luck involved in surviving, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.

This model analyzes various passenger attributes (such as class, sex, age, and fare) to predict whether a given passenger would have survived the disaster. It serves as a classic introductory project for machine learning, encompassing the full data science pipeline: data loading, exploration, cleaning, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

üìä Dataset
The project uses the classic Titanic dataset, which is publicly available on platforms like Kaggle.

Source: Kaggle Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster

The data is split into two files:

train.csv: Contains the features and the target variable (Survived). Used for training the model.

test.csv: Contains only the features. Used to make predictions for submission or final evaluation.

Data Dictionary
Variable	Definition	Key
PassengerId	Unique identifier for each passenger	
Survived	Target	0 = No, 1 = Yes
Pclass	Ticket class	1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd
Name	Passenger name	
Sex	Sex	
Age	Age in years	
SibSp	# of siblings / spouses aboard	
Parch	# of parents / children aboard	
Ticket	Ticket number	
Fare	Passenger fare	
Cabin	Cabin number	
Embarked	Port of Embarkation	C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton
üõ†Ô∏è Workflow & Technical Implementation
The notebook follows a structured and logical machine learning pipeline:

Data Loading and Inspection:

Imported necessary libraries (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn).

Loaded the training and test datasets.

Performed initial inspection using .head(), .info(), and .describe() to understand the structure and identify immediate issues like missing values.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualized the relationships between features and the target variable (Survived) using count plots and histograms.

Key insights from EDA:

Pclass: A strong correlation between passenger class and survival rate (higher class = higher survival chance).

Sex: Females had a significantly higher survival rate than males.

Age: Children had a higher chance of survival. Missing values were imputed based on intelligent grouping.

Fare: Higher fare payers tended to survive more.

Embarked: Port of embarkation showed a correlation with survival.

Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering:

Handled Missing Values:

Age: Missing values were filled with the median age grouped by Pclass and Sex.

Embarked: The few missing values were filled with the most frequent port ('S').

Fare: One missing value in the test set was filled with the median fare.

Cabin: Due to a large number of missing values, this feature was dropped for the initial model.

Engineered New Features:

FamilySize: Created from the sum of SibSp and Parch. This feature captured whether a passenger was alone or with family.

IsAlone: A binary feature derived from FamilySize to indicate if a passenger was alone on the ship.

Title: Extracted from the Name feature (e.g., Mr, Mrs, Miss, Master, Rare). This helped categorize passengers and impute Age more accurately.

Encoding Categorical Variables:

Label encoding was applied to features like Sex and Embarked.

The Title feature was also label encoded.

Model Training and Evaluation:

Data Preparation: The training data was split into a training set and a validation set using train_test_split to evaluate performance before final prediction.

Model Selection: Multiple classifiers were trained and compared using cross-validation:

Logistic Regression

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Support Vector Machine (SVC)

Random Forest Classifier

Gradient Boosting Classifier

Model Evaluation: Performance was measured using accuracy as the primary metric. The Random Forest model was identified as a top performer.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Used GridSearchCV to find the optimal hyperparameters for the Random Forest model, further improving its accuracy.

Prediction and Submission:

The final tuned model was used to make predictions on the preprocessed test set.

Predictions were saved into a submission.csv file in the required format for Kaggle.

üìà Results
The best performing model was the Random Forest Classifier after hyperparameter tuning.

The model achieved a cross-validation accuracy of ~83% on the training data.

This performance is competitive and aligns with standard results for this dataset using traditional machine learning models.

üöÄ How to Run This Project
Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn jupyter
Instructions
Clone this repository or download the TitanicSurvivalPredictor.ipynb notebook and the dataset files (train.csv, test.csv).

Place the CSV files in the same directory as the Jupyter notebook.

Open the notebook using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.

Run the cells sequentially to execute the entire data analysis and modeling pipeline.

The final cell will generate a submission.csv file containing the predictions for the test set.

üîÆ Future Work
Advanced Feature Engineering: Further explore the Cabin data by extracting the deck letter (e.g., A, B, C) from the first character, which might be correlated with survival.

Alternative Models: Experiment with more advanced models like XGBoost, LightGBM, or neural networks.

Ensemble Methods: Combine the predictions of multiple top-performing models (e.g., Random Forest and Gradient Boosting) using a voting classifier to potentially improve accuracy.

Detailed Error Analysis: Analyze the cases where the model was wrong to gain deeper insights into its limitations and potential biases.
